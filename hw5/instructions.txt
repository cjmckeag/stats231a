(1) Study and play with the following code for VAE

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/cvae

(a) Write a brief summary of the code. Annotate key lines.

(b) Let the dimension of hidden vector be 2, plot the generated g(z1, z2) for different (z1, z2). You can arrange the generated images in the 2-dimensional space according to (z1, z2).

(2) Study and play with the following code for tSNE

(a) Write a brief summary of the code. Annotate key lines.

(b) Vary the perplexity parameter and show results.

(3) Study and play with the following code for spectral embedding and clustering

(a) Write a brief summary of the code. Annotate key lines.

(b) Let the dimension of hidden vector be 2, plot the data in the latent space, and see if they form well separated clusters.
